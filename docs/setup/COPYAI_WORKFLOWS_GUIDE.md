# Copy.ai Workflows Setup Guide for Casey

## What Are Copy.ai Workflows?

Workflows in Copy.ai allow you to chain together AI actions to automate content creation tasks. Instead of using individual tools, you create a workflow once and reuse it via the API.

**Think of it like this:**
- **Tools** = Single actions (write a headline)
- **Workflows** = Multiple actions chained together (research â†’ outline â†’ write â†’ optimize)

## How to Access Workflows

1. **Log into Copy.ai**: https://app.copy.ai
2. **Look for "Workflows" in the left sidebar**
3. **Or go directly to**: https://app.copy.ai/workflows

## Option 1: Use Pre-Built Templates (EASIEST!)

Copy.ai has a Workflow Library with ready-made templates:

### Step-by-Step:

1. **Go to Workflows** in the left sidebar
2. **Click "Browse Templates"** or "Workflow Library"
3. **Popular templates for marketing**:
   - Product Description Generator
   - Blog Post Writer
   - Social Media Content Creator
   - Email Campaign Writer
   - Ad Copy Generator
   - SEO Meta Description Writer

4. **Select a template** that fits your needs
5. **Click "Try this" or "Use Template"**
6. The workflow is now in your account!
7. **Click on the workflow** to open it
8. **Look for the Workflow ID** (usually in the URL or workflow settings)
   - URL format: `https://app.copy.ai/workflow/{WORKFLOW_ID}`
   - Save this ID - you'll need it for API calls!

## Option 2: Create Custom Workflow

If you want to build your own workflow:

### Step-by-Step:

1. **Navigate to Workflows**
2. **Click "Create Workflow"** or "+ New Workflow"

3. **Set Up Your Trigger**:
   - Click "Add a Trigger"
   - Select **"Manual"** (for API/manual input)
   - Define your input fields:
     - Example: "productName", "targetAudience", "tone"

4. **Add Actions**:
   - Click "+ Add Step" or "Add Action"
   - **Popular actions**:
     - **AI Writer**: Generate text based on prompt
     - **Content Improver**: Enhance existing copy
     - **Tone Changer**: Adjust writing style
     - **SEO Optimizer**: Add keywords

5. **Configure Each Action**:
   - Write your prompt
   - Use variables from trigger: `{productName}`, `{targetAudience}`
   - Example prompt:
     ```
     Write a compelling product description for {productName}
     targeting {targetAudience} in a {tone} tone.
     Make it 150 words and include benefits.
     ```

6. **Test Your Workflow**:

## How to Use Workflows via API

Once you have your workflow set up:

### 1. Get Your Workflow ID

From the workflow URL or settings:
```
https://app.copy.ai/workflow/wf_abc123xyz
                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^
                              This is your ID
```

### 2. Make API Call

```javascript
const generateCopy = async (inputs) => {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.copy.ai/api/workflow/wf_abc123xyz', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'x-copy-ai-api-key': 'YOUR_API_KEY',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      startVariables: {
        productName: inputs.productName,
        targetAudience: inputs.targetAudience,
        tone: inputs.tone || 'professional'
      }
    })
  });

  const data = await response.json();
  return data.output;
};

// Example usage
const result = await generateCopy({
  productName: 'Smart Watch Pro',
  targetAudience: 'fitness enthusiasts',
  tone: 'energetic'
});

console.log(result);
```

### 3. Handle Response

```javascript
// Typical response structure
{
  "id": "run_xyz123",
  "workflowId": "wf_abc123xyz",
  "status": "completed",
  "output": {
    "generatedCopy": "Introducing the Smart Watch Pro...",
    "wordCount": 145,
    "suggestions": [...]
  }
}
```

## I Cannot Set It Up For You (But Here's Why)

I cannot directly log into your Copy.ai account to set up workflows because:

1. **Security**: I don't have access to your account credentials
2. **Privacy**: I shouldn't access your personal accounts
3. **Authentication**: Each account requires separate login

**BUT I CAN:**
- âœ… Provide these detailed instructions
- âœ… Recommend the best workflows for your needs
- âœ… Help you troubleshoot any issues
- âœ… Write the API integration code
- âœ… Guide you step-by-step
