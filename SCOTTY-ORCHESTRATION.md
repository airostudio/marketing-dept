# Scotty AI - Intelligent Marketing Orchestration System

## Overview

**Scotty** is the Master Marketing Orchestrator - a world-class AI system that intelligently manages a team of 15 specialized marketing agents. Scotty is the ONLY direct point of contact for users and autonomously routes tasks, coordinates multi-agent projects, and optimizes marketing operations without human supervision.

## How Scotty Works

### Core Intelligence

Scotty uses a sophisticated multi-layered decision system to route tasks:

1. **Multi-Agent Project Detection** - First checks if the request requires multiple agents working together (product launches, content strategies, demand gen campaigns, website overhauls)

2. **Keyword Scoring System** - Analyzes the user's request against 15 comprehensive keyword libraries, scoring each agent's capability match

3. **Confidence-Based Routing** - Selects the agent with the highest confidence score and logs the decision for transparency

4. **Default Fallback** - Routes unclear requests to Oscar Wright (Marketing Operations Coordinator) who can triage and redirect

### Task Complexity Assessment

Scotty automatically categorizes every request:

**Simple Tasks** (Single agent, <2 hours)
- Example: "Write a blog post about AI trends"
- Action: Direct assignment to Marcus Hayes
- Response Time: Immediate

**Moderate Tasks** (2-3 agents, 1-5 days)
- Example: "Create an SEO-optimized content series"
- Action: Marcus Hayes (primary) + Ryan Mitchell (SEO) + David Kim (analytics)
- Coordination: Basic dependency management

**Complex Projects** (4+ agents, 1+ weeks)
- Example: "Launch our new AI platform"
- Action: Full project plan with phases, milestones, and multi-agent coordination
