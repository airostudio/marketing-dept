# Then visit http://localhost:8000/dashboard.html
```

### 2. Explore Worker Details

### 3. Customize Your Setup
Edit the worker JSON files in `/agents/workers/` to:

- Add new tasks
- Configure integrations
- Adjust settings

## File Structure

```
ui/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dashboard.html          # Main dashboard
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ worker.html            # Worker detail page (dynamic)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.css             # All styling
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dashboard.js           # Dashboard functionality
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ worker.js              # Worker page functionality
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md              # This file
```

## Customization

### Update Worker Data
Edit the JSON files in `/agents/workers/`:
```javascript
{
  "id": "jasper-the-writer",
  "name": "Jasper",
  "metrics": {
    "wordsWrittenToday": 12500,  // Update this
    "contentPiecesCreated": 8
  }
}
```

### Add New Workers
1. Create a new JSON file in `/agents/workers/`
2. Add the worker to the dashboard in `dashboard.html`
3. Update the worker mapping in `worker.js`

### Customize Styling
Edit `styles.css` to change:
- Color scheme (CSS variables at top)
- Layout and spacing
- Animations and transitions
- Responsive breakpoints

### Add Features
The JavaScript files use vanilla JS for easy customization:
- `dashboard.js`: Main dashboard logic
- `worker.js`: Individual worker pages

## Real-time Updates

The dashboard simulates real-time updates:
- Metrics update every 10 seconds
- New activities appear every 30 seconds
- Progress bars animate on changes

To connect to real APIs:
1. Update the `loadWorkerData()` function in `dashboard.js`
2. Configure API endpoints in worker JSON files
3. Add authentication headers as needed

## Integration with AI Platforms

Each worker is configured to connect with its respective AI platform:

```javascript
"aiPlatform": {
  "name": "Jasper AI",
  "url": "https://www.jasper.ai",
  "apiKey": "JASPER_API_KEY"  // Replace with actual key
}
```

**Important**: Store API keys securely, never commit them to version control.

## Best Practices

### Security
- Never expose API keys in frontend code
- Use environment variables or backend proxy
- Implement proper authentication

### Performance
- Lazy load worker data
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Optimize images and assets
- Use CDN for external resources

### Accessibility
- All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Proper ARIA labels included
- Color contrast meets WCAG standards
- Screen reader friendly

## Browser Support

- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

## Mobile Responsive

The interface is fully responsive:
- Desktop: Full sidebar and multi-column layout
- Tablet: Optimized grid layouts
- Mobile: Stack layout with collapsible sidebar

## Notifications

The dashboard includes a notification system:
```javascript
showNotification('Title', 'Message', 'info');
// Types: info, success, warning, error
```

## Activity Feed

Real-time activity tracking:
```javascript
addActivity('‚úçÔ∏è', 'Jasper', 'completed a new blog post');
```

- [ ] Real API integrations
- [ ] Task assignment interface
